# Welcome to my github home page

So you know, I'm a middle school student and also a OIer in China. I usually write some tools to help myself in studying or daily training. And I realize that is fantastic to share them with you and every one who like studying computers or OI.

In my account, there are some project I really want to show with you. 

* **CodeLib-Local** . When you are practicing coding or learning alogirthms, you might want to solve some problems on OJ (online judges) like AtCoder or CodeForces, etc. But every time you want to find some code of these problems, it's quiet a painful work. You need to look them up in hundreds of websites and copy them one by one into you editor such as VSCode. So I decide to write a application that storage those code automatlly and you are able search and copy the code easilly. That the why I develop this app: CodeLib-Local, if u want to try it, you can download and run it [here](https://github.com/lixuannan/CodeLib-Local)
* **ComputerEverywhere** This is a developing project, you can learn about it in the link down bellow the pin projects. If you want to develop it with me, you can communicat me by email: codingcow@163.com or phone: +86 18819284430
